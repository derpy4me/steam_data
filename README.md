# Overview

This script is a simple implementation of pandas and data analysis functions that provide some statistics on steams top 100 played games.  
Three questions are answered:

1. What is the average cost of the top 100 games?
2. What is the most popular genre in the top 100 games?
3. What is the average cost of the top 100 games per genre?

This was an oportunity to become familiar with working with Pandas DataFrames and give me an opportunity to do some Data Analysis with real time data. This had some interesting results with what genres were most played and with which cost the most.

# Development Environment

I Used the Python language and worked with multiple libraries.

- Pandas: A library used for data analysis.
- Requests: A library for http communication
- Math: Python's built in library for working with numbers.
- Pprint: A library to prettify data output to the CLI.
